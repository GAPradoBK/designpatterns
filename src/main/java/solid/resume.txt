SRP - Single Responsibility Principle

The single responsibility principle is a computer programming principle that states that every
module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by
the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.
All its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.
Robert C. Martin expresses the principle as, "A class should have only one reason to change,"
although, because of confusion around the word "reason" he more recently stated "This principle is about people."

OCP - Open-Closed Principle

In object-oriented programming, the open/closed principle states "software entities
(classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification";
that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.

The name open/closed principle has been used in two ways.
Both ways use generalizations (for instance, inheritance or delegate functions)
to resolve the apparent dilemma, but the goals, techniques, and results are different.
